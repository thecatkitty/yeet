## Why the name?
This project is meant to become a `git`-compatible local VCS for DOS-based developer platforms, eg. for retro game development purposes. Old-English word *git* used to be pronounced [jit] and *yeet* is pronounced [ji:t] in Modern English, so it's almost the same. To be honest, if you shout it loudly, there's probably no difference. That's one reason.

The second reason is that the word *yeet* has a positive meaning. According to the Wiktionary, it's a word used to express excitement or approval, also a type of happy dance and a verb connected with quick motion.

The last thing is that there is no command line tool with such name, in Ubuntu repositories at least.

*Yeet or be yeeted.*
